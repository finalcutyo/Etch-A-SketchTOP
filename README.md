# The Etch-A-Sketch Webpage

This project is a culmination of the techniques learned in The Odin Project Fundamentals Path.

I will be building a working *etch-a-sketch*-like webpage. It will have a grid that responds to a mouse. 

Each square on the grid will change to a different color after clicking on it. 

The grid will be created using JavaScript and be sorted using CSS.
The rest of the page will be built with CSS and HTML.

Colors that fill each square will be chosen by the user. They can also be reset to the original color by the user. 

I think I'll call it... GRIDDRAW!

## First GIT push

#### Summary 
I pushed here with the idea that I would at least get the skeleton on these files and kinda let myself grasp the whole idea. 

1. Set up the initial grid for the sketcher with a hard grid size and have a generic hover CSS. 
2. Set up the boilerplate for the HTML.

##### TODO: 
- Set up the sketcher with a changing grid size using a slider.
- Have a color picker for the squares
- Set up a reset button


## Second GIT push

#### Summary
This is essentially the baseline finished project. If I were many years younger and in school still, this would be the passing grade. But since this is for practice and I can't handle this borderline finished thing being the final project, I want to make it look and function much better. The script just feels ugly and unfinished and there's so much more I feel I can do. 
Sidenote: I tried changing the container to have a grid style layout rather than a flexbox style... but I spent so much time thinking about using a for loop and building the grid like how it is presented in the script that I just decided to leave it. One day I may learn how CSS grid works..... but not today.  

1. Added a slider that changes the size of the grid
2. Added a reset button that redraws the grid when clicked
3. When hovering over a square on the grid with a mouse, the square changes to a set color
4. Input added that lets the player choose a color to change each square on hover

##### TODO: 
- Add some small style elements to make the GRIDDRAW app look a little better 
- Think of some feature ideas to make the project a little more unique feeling
