# The Etch-A-Sketch Webpage

This project is a culmination of the techniques learned in The Odin Project Fundamentals Path.

I will be building a working *etch-a-sketch*-like webpage. It will have a grid that responds to a mouse. 

Each square on the grid will change to a different color after clicking on it. 

The grid will be created using JavaScript and be sorted using CSS.
The rest of the page will be built with CSS and HTML.

Colors that fill each square will be chosen by the user. They can also be reset to the original color by the user. 

## First GIT push
1. Set up the initial grid for the sketcher with a hard grid size and have a generic hover CSS. 
2. Set up the boilerplate for the HTML.

TODO: 
- Set up the sketcher with a changing grid size using a slider.
- Have a color picker for the squares
- Set up a reset button
